SHORT DESCRIPTION
	The ProgramManager module supports running custom scriptblocks on installation
	of packages.
    
SCRIPTBLOCK OVERVIEW
    The Pre-InstallScriptblock runs before the main installation logic is executed.
    This will be before any package is copied/installer starts etc.
    
    The Post-InstallScriptblock runs after the main installation logic is executed.
    This will be after any package is copied/installer finishes and exits.
    
    You can run any arbitrary code within these scriptblocks. There is no limit to what
    you can do. Bear in mind that complex scripts will increase execution time.
	
    
SCRIPTBLOCK SETUP
    To utilise the full potential of the scriptblocks, you can manipulate data passed
    in from the Invoke-PMInstall command.
    
    Whilst you can recieve package data, any changes you do will be lost, as the object
    is never returned back to the main Invoke-PMInstall function.
