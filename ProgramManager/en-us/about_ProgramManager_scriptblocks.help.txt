SHORT DESCRIPTION
	The ProgramManager module supports running custom scriptblocks on installation
	of packages.
	
SCRIPTBLOCK OVERVIEW
	The Pre-InstallScriptblock runs before the main installation logic is executed.
	This will be before any package is copied/installer starts etc.
	
	The Post-InstallScriptblock runs after the main installation logic is executed.
	This will be after any package is copied/installer finishes and exits.
	
	You can run any arbitrary code within these scriptblocks. There is no limit to what
	you can do. Bear in mind that complex scripts will increase execution time.
	
	
	An example of use cases for these scriptblocks:
		- Replace the program data folder in %appdata% with a symlink pointing to a
			folder containing the data in a different location.
		- Create a shortcut for a portable program and place it in the Start Menu.
		- Copy over data files to a hardcoded folder which can't be symlinked.
	
SCRIPTBLOCK SETUP
	To utilise the full potential of the scriptblocks, you can manipulate data passed
	in from the Invoke-PMInstall command.
	
	Whilst you can receive package data, any changes you do will be lost, as the object
	is never returned back to the main Invoke-PMInstall function.
	
	
	Include this parameter definition in the scriptblock to get the ProgramManager.Package object:
	
		Param (
			
			# The package object corresponding to the package being currently installed
			[System.Collections.Generic.List[psobject]]
			$package
			
		)
		
	
	To see a full list of ProgramManager.Package object properties, run: Get-PMPackage "<name>" -ShowFullDetail
		
SCRIPTBLOCK EXAMPLE
	
	$scriptblock = {
	Param (
		
		# The package object of the package being currently installed
		[System.Collections.Generic.List[psobject]]
		$package
		
	)
	
	Remove-Item -Path "%appdata%\Code\User" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
	New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "%appdata%\Code\User" -Value "D:\Programs\Data\VSCode"
	
	}
	
	This example redirects the User profile folder for Visual Studio Code to a location on the D:\ drive.
	This scriptblock is run post-installation.
